why are we using an adjacency matrix over an adjacency list?

a. we have a small fixed number of areas. (5 nodes is not a problem to store)

b. we need fast lookups

When you’re running Dijkstra’s Algorithm, you repeatedly check:

if (graph[u][v] != 0)


to see if there’s a connection between u and v.

With a matrix, this is O(1) — just a direct access in memory.
With a list, you’d have to traverse the neighbors of u every time.

So your shortest path computations are faster and simpler this way.
